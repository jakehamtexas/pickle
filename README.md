# pickle

A color picker over a websocket, with a deno backend

## Why?

I wanted to see what Deno was like.

## Well, what is it like?

Node.

## Usage

This isn't fancy. Just clone this bad sucker down and run a live server in a couple of different browser windows. Use this command to run the server:

```bash
deno run --allow-net server/main.ts
```

Make sure you have deno installed (yadoi)

## TODO

Maybe someday this can be a real web application instead of a quick and dirty toy.
